So everything begins from the class called game, which ofers the score, round, points, and the time of the current game.
To win the game you have to destroy the base, that is another class. For the based to be destroid, the troops need to deal enought damage to it so the troops are another class called "troops". Each troop has its own statistic thats gonna be influenced by another objects.

Towers will deal damage to the troops, so thats how their hp will decrease. The weather will influence the troops movement speed, range, atack speed, damage and armor reduction. Also there will be heros that will fight agains the troops. Another class that will interact with troops is "Spells". They will deal damage or slow down the troops.

About the towers they are as well a class that has their own statsistic. You can upgrade the towers by using money. Money are as well a class. Money will interact with a lot of classes, such as hero, spells, and towers.
